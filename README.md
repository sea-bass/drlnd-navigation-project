## Getting Started

First, perform the setup in the Udacity repo. Namely,

1. Install conda and create a Python 3.6 virtual environment
2. Install OpenAI Gym
3. Clone the Udacity repo and install the Python requirements included
4. Download the Banana World Unity files appropriate for your OS

Once you have performed this setup, you should be ready to run the Jupyter Notebook in this repo.
