# Deep Reinforcement Learning - Banana World Navigation Project
By Sebastian Castro, 2020

## Learning Algorithm
### Approach

Plain DQN with decaying learning rate

### Neural Network Architecture

TBD

### Hyperparameters

TBD

## Results

Plot of results here.

## Future Work

Hyperparameter tuning / ablation studies

Different neural network structure -- e.g., stacking multiple time steps' observations (like with the Atari paper) or even adding recurrent elements like GRU/LSTM cells could be beneficial to capture previously seen bananas that have gone out of view.

Different learning algorithms -- i.e. expected Q-learning, double DQN, dueling DQN, Rainbow, etc.
